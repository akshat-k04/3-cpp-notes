1. **Server**
   - A server is a computer or a software system that provides functionality or services to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can serve various purposes, such as hosting websites, managing email, storing files, or providing access to databases.
2. **Server for Hosting Websites**
   - We can modify our computer as a server or use any cloud provider like Vercel.

3. **Server for Database**
   - MongoDB Atlas is a cloud database service provider where we can create our server for DBMS.
   - On AWS, you can create a server (virtual machine) to host your MySQL server.

4. **MySQL Workbench**
   - It is like VSCode where we can write our code.

5. **MySQL Shell**
   - It is like a terminal where we can run any command.

6. **MySQL Server**
   - MySQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores and manages data. It is where your databases will reside, and it handles data storage, retrieval, and management tasks. When you install MySQL Server, you're installing the core database system.

7. **Conclusion**
   - To store data, we have to use a database.
   - To manage a database, we have to use a DBMS (MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server).
   - To use a DBMS, we have to create a server (so that we can perform operations on the database).
   - The server is created on a machine (either my computer or any cloud provider like AWS).
   - In the case of MongoDB, the machine is MongoDB Atlas where the server is created, and we use the MongoDB DBMS.
