1.Constructor in C++ is a special method that is invoked automatically at the 
  time of object creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects 
  generally.

2.The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure.

3.Constructor is invoked at the time of object creation.It constructs the values 
  i.e. provides data for the object which is why it is known as constructors.

4.Constructor do not return value, hence they do not have a return type.

5.types of constructor
    • Default constructor(implicit and explicit)
    • Parameterized constructor
    • Overloaded constructor
    • Constructor with default value
    • Copy constructor
    • Inline constructor

6.
  a.implicit default constructor:- if we not write constructor then the constructor 
                                 the compiler calls is This.

  b.explicit default constructor:-construct(){
                                      a = 10;
                                      
                                      cin>>b ;
                                      or we can use
                                      //b = 20;
                                  }
                                  this is called as EDC where we set the default 
                                  value of object .
  
  c. Parameterized constructor :- where we need to pass the argument
                                   construct(int x1, int y1)
                                   {
                                       x = x1;
                                       y = y1;
                                   }


  d. constructor overloading means we make 2 or 3 or 4 ... constructor with different argument 
     example construct(){a=5}, construct(int c){a=c} ,construct(int b,int g){a=b+d}
     based on argument we provide during initializing the constructor called 

  e. rest are time pass
  
*************imp***********

1.A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
  if we not write constructor then default constructor will called after object creation
  if we write then that will called

chat gpt:-If you don't write a constructor in a class, the compiler will automatically
          generate a default constructor for you. This default constructor doesn't 
          have any parameters and doesn't contain any explicit code. When you create 
          an object of that class, the default constructor will be executed.


2.It must be placed in public section of class.
