The static keyword has different meanings when used with different types. 
We can use static keywords with:

1.Static Variables: Variables in a function, Variables in a class
2.Static Members of Class: Class objects and Functions in a class Let us now 
  look at each one of these uses of static in detail.


---------static variables----------
When a variable is declared as static, space for it gets allocated for the 
lifetime of the program. Even if the function is called multiple times, space 
for the static variable is allocated only once and the value of the variable 
in the previous call gets carried through the next function call. 

eg:-
void demo(){
    static int count = 0;
    cout << count << " ";
    count++;
}
 
int main()for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)demo();

output :- 0 1 2 3 4 


-------static memeber of class----------
As the variables declared as static are initialized only once as they are allocated 
space in separate static storage so, the static variables in a class are shared by 
the objects. There can not be multiple copies of the same static variables for 
different objects. Also because of this reason static variables can not be initialized 
using constructors. 
So, a static variable inside a class should be initialized explicitly by the user 
using the class name and scope resolution operator outside the class.
eg:-
class GfG {
public:
    static int i;
};
int GfG::i = 1;

value of i is same for all objects

-----------static function of class---------
 It is a member function that is used to access only static data members. It cannot 
 access non-static data members not even call non-static member functions. It can be 
 called even if no objects of the class exist. It is also used to maintain a single 
 copy of the class member function across different objects of the class.
