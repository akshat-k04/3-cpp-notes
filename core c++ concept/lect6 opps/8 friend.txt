1.let in class we have private member named money the object have
2.i want to calculate the sum of all money
3.so what we do is this

class profile{
    private:
        int money ;
    public:
        int getMoney(){
            return money ;
        }
}

int sum(profile akshat,profile garvit){
    int ans = akshat.getMoney() +garvit.getMoney() ;
    return ans ;
}

int main(){
    profile akshat ,garvit ;
    cout<<sum ;
}

this is what we do we call function getMoney()  that will give us

4.instead of calling function getMoney we directly access private member
 just like public members 
 by writing friend sum(profile a,profile b) ;
 in class 


5.this will say that this function is friend of the class

6.NOTE:- friend function is not member function it is normal function with spcial 
         power of accessing the private values
