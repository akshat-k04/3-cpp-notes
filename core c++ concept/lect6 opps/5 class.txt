1.we can say class as a advance form of struct where we can add function to it ,
  make things public and private

2.public members:-
  All the variables and functions declared under public access modifier will be 
  available for everyone. They can be accessed both inside and outside the class.
  Dot (.) operator is used in the program to access public data members directly.

3.Private members:-
  All the variables and functions declared under a private access modifier can only 
  be used inside the class. They are not permissible to be used by any object or 
  function outside the class.
