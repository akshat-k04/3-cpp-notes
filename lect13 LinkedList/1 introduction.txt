A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.


drawbacks of linked list 
Direct access to an element is not possible in a linked list as in an array by index.
Searching for an element is costly and requires O(n) time complexity.
Sorting of linked lists is very complex and costly.
Appending an element to a linked list is a costly operation, and takes O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the linked list, as compared to arrays that take O(1) time.



types of linked list :

simple/singly linked list
doubly linked list
circular linked list
doubly circular linked list
