/*
why opps ?

  1.c++ was designed with the main intension of adding object oriented features to c language 
  2.as the size of the program increases , readibility , maintainability and bug free nature of program decrease 
  3.this was the major problem with the language like c which relied upon function or procedure 
  4.as a result the possibility of not addressing  the problem in the effective manner was high 
  5. also, as data was almost negllected , data security was easily compromised 
  6.using classes solves this problem by modelling programs as a real world senario

 /*     *****Difference between Procedure Oriented Programming and Object-Oriented Programming ****
 
Procedure Oriented Programming:-
                    1.Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow
                    2.The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data
                    3.Functions can either use local or global data
                    4.Data moves openly from function to function
Object-Oriented Progamming:-
                    1.Works on the concept of classes and object
                    2.A class is a template to create objects
                    3.Treats data as a critical element
                    4.Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the object
*/

/*                *****Basic Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming*****

1.Classes - Basic template for creating objects
2.objects – Basic run-time entities
3.Data Abstraction & Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
4.Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others
5.Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one forms
6.Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
7.Message Passing – message (Information) call format
*/



/*               *****Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming******

1.Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
2.Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
3.Multiple Objects can co-exist without any interference
4.Software complexity can be easily managed
