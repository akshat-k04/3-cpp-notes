/*                  ***variable***
A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. 

1.The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
2.A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
3.In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.


Types of variables

There are three types of variables based on the scope of variables in C++: 
 

1.Local Variables:A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable. 
2.Instance Variables: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block. 
3.Static Variables:Static variables are also known as Class variables. 
                   These variables are declared similarly as instance variables, the difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.
