1. BST is a binary but here we have all elements on the left node are smaller than the root node
   and right node are greater then root node

2. the structure of bst is totslly depends on order in which we add element 
  eg:- if we add root as 100 then we add 50 then 130 then 40 we get 
                       100
                   50        130
                40     

    but if we add 100 then 40 then 130 then 50 we get
                        100
                     40      130
                       50 
                       this
