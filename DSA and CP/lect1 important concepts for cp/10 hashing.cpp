// Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.

// Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example if the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5} in the array or Hash table respectively.

// Hashing Data Structure

// Hash table (also, hash map) is a data structure that basically maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the corresponding value can be found.

// basically hashing and hashmaps are relatable and this are v simple as we do generally make 
// a array tot store numbers
