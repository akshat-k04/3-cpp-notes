to find the time complexity of recursion find how many times the function calls 
then find time complexity of running 1 function
then multiply both to get total time complexity

eg

for factorial recursion tc = n*1 // n= now of times fucntion calls 1 is time com. of running the function

for all permutation of 1,2,3,...n 
tc is = n! * n 

similar concept for space complexity as well
