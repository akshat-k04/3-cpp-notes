/*
graph and tree are both similar
when the graph is is not cyclic it is called tree that is why 
***** if tree has n nodes then it has n-1 edges *******


there are 2 types of graphs
1. undirected graph
2. directed graph



graph has node also called as vertex

all node or vertex are connected 
the connecting line is called edge
edge of directed graph he direction where as undirected does not has


//path means what comes after this node eg:- 1 2 3  but we cant make path ike 1 3 2 3 4 path must not contain any node more than one time
degree of any node:- is no. of edges connected with node for undirected graph 
for directed graph:- indegree = no. of incomming egdes 
out degree = no. of out going edges

weight :- it is assigned for edge 
if we dont assign the by defalut all has unit weight


to store any graph we can use vector<vii> a(n+1) where every element store a vector and every vector store the neighbour of each other
in directed graph we store the neighbour we can go from this node
